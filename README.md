Pretty much everything is cached already. If you want to make something with it, go for it! If you want to, feel free to contribute! I don't have any specific style rules, but if I think something is ugly I'll correct it.

This is a library for [Slack](https://slack.com)'s API written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/). Kotlin is completely interoperable with Java, so if you don't know Kotlin you can still interact with the API through Java ([see here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-to-kotlin-interop.html))
